# KC Pothole Predictions

This repository contains the documentation and notebook behind a fully deployed web app located at http://kc-pothole-predictions.herokuapp.com/, which allows for fully interactive (and intentionally light-hearted) predictions for how long a pothole in Kansas City would take to be filled, based an XGBoost model. The process of creating, and insights from the model are also located on the web app. The Python notebook can be found in the repo in 'notebooks'.
